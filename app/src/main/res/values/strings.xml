    "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
    "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
    "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
    "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
    "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
    "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
    "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
    "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
    "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
    "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

    "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

    "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
    "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
    "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
    "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
    "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
    "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
    "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

    "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

    "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
    "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
    "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
    "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
    "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
    "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efÔ¨Åcient yet coherent.\n\n"

    "3D world.\n\n"

    "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
    "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
    "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
    "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
    "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
    "emulated by manipulating the y-axis."
